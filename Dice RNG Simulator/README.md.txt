## Introduction

There are various uses for a Random Number Generator. The best games involve some degree of skill and luck. Here, we offer a humble random dice roll ranging from a four-sided die to twenty-sided die and up to ten total dice. In this project, we offer one such dice roll simulation.

## Requirements

The RNG should consist of:

- An input box to assign how many dice to roll
- A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20)
- Function taking the inputs from the form
- An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
- Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)
